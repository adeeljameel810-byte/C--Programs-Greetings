# 🚀 MyCppJourney

Welcome to my **C++ learning journey**! 💻✨  
This repository will contain all the **codes I will write while learning C++ from scratch to advanced**. I will follow the **YouTube playlist "Apna College"** and will practice everything hands-on.  

### 📖 My Programming Story
I started learning programming when I am  in **University Life** 🏫, and **C++ is  my first programming language**. I will complete the **Apna College playlist**, which will help me  in building a strong foundation in programming concepts.  

 when I joined **Mehran University of Engineering and Technology** 🏛️ in the **Software Engineering department**, I started learning **C++ ** because my **first-year, first-semester subject,  Programming Fundamentals**, focuses on C++. This has given me a chance to **learn  concepts and strengthen my foundation**  more and more.  

C++ is my **first programming language**, and I chose it because it is the **mother of all programming languages**. Learning C++ first gives a **solid foundation** that makes learning other languages like Python 🐍, Java ☕, and more much easier in the future.

💡 **Why this repository is important:**  
Starting with C++ builds a **solid programming foundation**. Understanding memory management, pointers, OOP, and advanced C++ features early on makes learning other programming languages much faster and smoother.  

This repo is organized **sequentially**, from beginner-friendly code like `Hello World` 👋 to advanced C++ concepts. Perfect for anyone who wants to **learn C++ the right way**, step by step!

### 🌟 Fun Fact:
C++ is not just a language; it’s a **superpower for developers**! 💪 Learning it first gives you control over **memory, performance, and system-level programming**, which most high-level languages abstract away.  

Happy coding! 🚀
